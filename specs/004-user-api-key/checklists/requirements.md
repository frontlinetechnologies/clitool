## Notes

- This feature is partially implemented (FR-001 through FR-005 are complete)
- New work required for FR-006 through FR-013 (config file support, validation, error messages)
- The spec documents both existing and new functionality for completeness
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
